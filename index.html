    <p style="color:black;" style="align:justify;">
        Recently there has been a drive towards designing smart cities and smart homes, as well as an increased usage of smart devices, ranging from smart electricity and gas meters to baby monitors to the now ubiquitous intelligent personal assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Home. These cyber-physical systems are distinguished from previous generations by virtue of extremely wide deployment (e.g., UK is encouraging usage of smart meters; devices like Alexa are popular Christmas presents). These large deployments bring us to an era of urban scale cyber physical systems and raises a number of interesting research challenges.
    </p>
    
    <p style="color:black;">
        To address the emerging challenges, this UK-India Partnership Development workshop brings together subject experts and researchers from India and the UK, to creatively expand our understanding of ‘Engineering Privacy Aware Urban Scale Cyber Physical Systems’. The workshop is organised around a set of following three themes.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Data sources and lifecyle in urban CPS<h4> 
        
    <p style="color:black;">
        When data is being collected at urban scale, it may contain personal information. This raises issues of data lifecycle management: how to register data usage and ethically inform the user; how to keep data secure during processing, and how to remove data, subject to user request (or even demise).
     </p>
    
    <h4>Privacy and Security</h4>
        
    <p style="color:black;">
     The heterogeneity of data sources and consequent security and privacy requirements (e.g., smart meter data may have different usage and privacy requirements than baby monitor data)
    </p>
    
    <h4>Urban Scale Infrastructure</h4>
    <p style="color:black;">
      System building aspect of urban scale cyber-physical systems--whether alternative and cheaper data sources can be found to solve a given problem, for example people can act as social sensors and explicitly report a complaint about infrastructures (e.g., a lamp post), effectively replacing, costly new sensor deployment.
    </p>
    
    <p style="color:black;">
        This workshop is funded by the UKIERI and DST to foster a growing research field and build a community of researchers to help identify core research questions and greatly boost the development of urban scale technologies in both India and the UK. Workshop participants (in collaborative groups) will develop proposals for projects investigating novel scalable and privacy preserving urban CPS technologies. Proposed outcomes encompass concrete roadmaps (including potential grant applications) that will be pursued post-workshop.

    <h2>Organizers</h2>
    <p>
        Here&rsquo;s a good place to list the organizers and sponsors of the conference,
        as well as list contact information for the organizers,
        and show off the logos of the sponsors.
        It looks like his conference was sponsored by kittens!
